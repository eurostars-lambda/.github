# Commit message format

All commits on `main` branches must follow a format for the commit message (subject, body and optional footers)
according to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) specification. The basic
structure is shown below and explained further in the following section.

```
<type>[(<scope>)]: <description> [(#<PR or issue number>)]

[<body>]

[<footer>]
```

## Commit type

We define the following types as supported by
[commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum),
which in turn are derived from [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#type):

- `build:` change the build system or external dependencies (for example, CMakeLists.txt, Dockerfile, package.xml)
- `ci:` change CI configuration files and scripts (for example, GitHub actions and workflows)
- `chore:` perform any general maintenance or work that is not accurately described by any other type
- `docs:` change only documentation lines or files
- `feat:` introduce, enhance or modify a feature
- `fix:` resolve an issue, bug, or error
- `perf:` improve performance without changing existing features or functionality
- `refactor:` change code structure or organization without changing existing features or functionality
- `release:` change only the package version and changelog to mark a new release
- `revert:` rollback a previous commit without making any other changes
- `style:` format / reformat code to adhere to style guidelines
- `test:` introduce, enhance or modify unit tests

## Commit scope

The commit scope is optional and can be used to categorize the change. It should preferably be a single noun but may be
a short phrase. For example,

- `feat(api): <description>`
- `fix(controllers): <description>`
- `docs(component services): <description>`

## Description 

The description should be a single lowercase line in the imperative mood and should effectivley summarize the changes
in the commit. When the commit is the result of a Pull Request or otherwise addresses an Issue, then the PR or issue
number should be added to the end of the description in parantheses. See the examples at the end for reference.

## Optional body text

The commit body can be used to describe the commit changes in more detail. The following formatting guidelines should be
respected:

- Sentences in the body should be capitalized and punctuated
- The body should be written in paragraphs of proper sentences starting in the imperative
- Paragraphs in the body should be separated by a new line
- The line width of all commit messages should be limited to 72 characters, with line breaks added in sentences as
  needed

## Breaking changes

If a commit includes breaking changes to the ABI or API of the package output, this must be clearly marked by adding an
exclamation point `!` after the commit type (or after the scope, if there is one). In addition, the commit body should
include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` description to clearly summarize the effects of the change.

## General guidelines

The default commit types are `feat` and `fix`, which should always be associated with user-facing changes to the code.
Whether the code is actually public to human users or part of an internal library, user-facing changes are any changes
to the ABI, API or code behavior that affect the intended or expected usage. Everything else is infrastructural.

For this reason, do not combine the `feat` or `fix` types with a scope that overlaps an existing commit
type (`build`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `test`). Use the corresponding commit type instead.

Avoid:

- `feat(ci): <description>`
- `feat(docs): <description>`
- `fix(test): <description>`

Instead, use the appropriate commit type.

- `ci: <description>`
- `docs: <description>`
- `test: <description>`

To be explicit about changes that fix repository infrastructure, even if they do not constitute a user-facing fix,
simply use the appropriate imperative description:

`fix(build): <description>`    → `build: fix ...`

The body of the commit message can refer to issues, PRs or other commits in the same repository by using a hashtag
followed by the GitHub issue or PR number or by using the shortened commit hash. When referring to resources from other
repositories, use the full URL.

## Examples

### Subject only

```
feat: add the option to breathe underwater (#123)
```

### Subject and body

```
fix: prevent drowning when underwater breathing is enabled (#124)

Install and use the scuba diving equipment correctly.
```

### Subject and scope

```
feat(api): implement some new endpoint (#125)
```

### Subject and longer body

```
feat: add some other shiny new feature (#126)

Add library XYZ to the manifest and update the package lock.

Import tool ABC from library XYZ to add the feature described in #101.

Remove old feature X. Because the new feature replaces feature X,
it can safely be deleted.
```

### Breaking change

```
refactor!: rename function to lower_snake_case (#127)
```

### Breaking change with scope and breaking change description

```
feat(api)!: simplified payload format (#128)

BREAKING CHANGE: use JSON for the payload instead of XML.
```
